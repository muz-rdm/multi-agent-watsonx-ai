The notebook employs the crewai library to create and manage a team of agents, each specialized in a specific task, using IBM watsonx LLM and other tools to execute their roles.\n"}, {"metadata": {}, "cell_type": "markdown", "source": "# Definition of Multi-agent System\nA multiagent system is a system where multiple intelligent agents interact or work together to solve problems that are beyond the capabilities of a single agent. These agents can operate independently or collaboratively, each bringing their own expertise and capabilities to the table. In this notebook, the multiagent system is used to simulate a research and writing scenario involving two specialized agents.\n"}, {"metadata": {}, "cell_type": "markdown", "source": "# Scenario\nThe scenario involves two agents working together to produce a detailed output on the topic of quantum computing:\n\n`Researcher Agent`: A senior AI researcher tasked with finding promising research in the field of quantum computing. This agent uses IBM watsonx LLM and a search tool to gather information and summarize the findings.\n\n`Writer Agent`: A senior speech writer responsible for crafting an engaging keynote speech based on the research provided by the Researcher Agent. This agent leverages the IBM watsonx LLM to structure and write the speech.\n\nThe Crew class orchestrates the workflow, coordinating the tasks and ensuring that each agent's output feeds into the next step of the process. The agents work autonomously within their defined roles, contributing to the overall objective of producing a well-researched and well-written keynote speech on quantum computing.\n"}, {"metadata":
